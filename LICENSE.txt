Mattermost Licensing

SOFTWARE LICENSING 

Mattermost server is made available under two separate licensing options:

- Free Software Foundation’s GNU AGPL v.3.0, subject to the exceptions outlined in this policy; or 
- Commercial licenses available from SpinPunch, Inc. by contacting commercial@mattermost.com 

Admin Tools and Configuration Files (model/, web/static/, web/templates/, web/react/utils/, api/templates/ and all 
subdirectories thereof) are made available under: 

- Apache License v2.0 

LICENSING POLICY 

The objective of the Mattermost server license is to require enhancements to Mattermost server be shared with the community 
while allowing for non-enhanced use in proprietary applications. 

Therefore, the Mattermost server is free to use, modify and redistribute in open source applications via the 
copyleft AGPL license. For proprietary applications (systems that don’t share source back to the community), 
Mattermost is free to use and redistribute so long as you’re not withholding proprietary enhancements to the 
Mattermost server and you’re only linking directly to Admin Tools and Configuration Files (defined above), which 
are released under an Apache 2.0 license, and copyleft free. 

We promise that we will not enforce the copyleft provisions in AGPL v3.0 against you if your application (a) does 
not link to the Mattermost server directly, but exclusively uses the Mattermost Admin Tools and Configuration files, 
and (b) you have not modified, added to or adapted the source code of Mattermost in a way that results in the creation 
of a “modified version” or “work based on” Mattermost as these terms are defined in the AGPL v3.0 license. 

If the above is not enough to satisfy your organization’s legal department (some will not approve GPL in any form), 
commercial licenses are available from commercial@mattermost.com.
