# Link Preview Tests

Link previews should embed previews of the contents of a hyperlink from a message or comment in the center channel directly below the message or comment.

Post location variation: 

1. Post as message in center channel with RHS closed (link preview should render under message) 
2. Post as message in center channel with RHS open (link preview should render under message) 
3. Post as comment in RHS (link preview should not render) 
4. View comment in center channel with RHS closed (link preview should render under message) 
5. View comment in center channel with RHS open (link preview should render under message) 
6. Search for post in RHS with link
