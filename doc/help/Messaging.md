# Messaging

## Writing Messages

You can write messages using the input box with the text "Write a message..." at the bottom of Mattermost. 

Press **ENTER** to send a message. Use **Shift+ENTER** to create a new line without sending a message. 

## Formatting Messages

Mattermost messages are formatted using a standard called "markdown". Here are examples: 

| Text Entered | How it appears |
|:---------------|:---------------|
|`**bold**`| **bold** |   
| `_italic_`|_italic_|

## Mentioning Teammates

You can mention a teammate by using the `@` symbol plus their username to send them a special notification to draw their attention. 

For example, you might write: 

```
@alice how did your interview go with the new candidate?
``` 

Which sends a special mention notification to **alice** to check your message. 

To mention a teammate, press `@` and you should see a list of team members who can be messaged. You can either type their username or use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys and then **ENTER** to select them to be mentioned. 

You can configure how you'd like to be alerted about mentions of your username, your first name, your nickname, or other keywords from **Account Settings** > **Notifications** and you can set channel-specific preferences from **[Channel Name]** > **Notification Preferences**
