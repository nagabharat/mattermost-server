# Team Statistics

Statistics on users, posts and channels are tracked for each team and viewable in the System Console. System Administrators can access statistics for your Mattermost teams by clicking the **three-dot menu**, then click **System Console**. Under the *Teams* section on the left side youâ€™ll see a list of the teams that belong to your domain. Click **Statistics** under the team of interest to open the stats page. Here is some helpful terminology:
